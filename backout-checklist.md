# AWS Backout Plan Checklist for Express.js Web Application Deployment

### 1. **Backup and Snapshot Preparation**
- [ ] **Ensure up-to-date backups of databases (RDS/other)**  
  Before deployment, confirm that automatic backups are enabled for your database, and manually create a snapshot of the database to ensure you have a reliable point to restore from.
- [ ] **Take snapshots of EC2 instances and EBS volumes**  
  Create snapshots of all EC2 instances and EBS volumes to capture the current state of your application and configuration for quick rollback.
- [ ] **Backup S3 bucket data**  
  Ensure that all critical data stored in S3 buckets is backed up or versioned, particularly if the deployment will involve changes to the S3 storage structure.

### 2. **Version Control and Code Rollback**
- [ ] **Tag the current stable version in version control (Git)**  
  Ensure that you tag the current stable state of your application in your version control system (e.g., `git tag v1.0-stable`).
- [ ] **Verify deployment of previous version is easily accessible**  
  Confirm that the last known good deployment version is documented, and rollback procedures (such as redeploying a previous build) are well-documented.
  
### 3. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Health Checks**
- [ ] **Ensure ELB health checks are properly configured**  
  Confirm that your load balancer has health checks enabled for the application instances. If the new version fails, the load balancer can automatically stop routing traffic to unhealthy instances.
  
### 4. **Database Schema Rollback Plan**
- [ ] **Have a rollback script for any database schema changes**  
  If the deployment involves database migrations or schema changes, prepare a script that can revert those changes (e.g., `down` migrations).
- [ ] **Test schema migration rollback process in a staging environment**  
  Ensure that any database rollback scripts have been tested in a staging environment to verify data integrity after rollback.

### 5. **Infrastructure as Code Rollback**
- [ ] **Revert to previous CloudFormation stack or Terraform state**  
  If infrastructure changes are being applied via Infrastructure as Code (e.g., AWS CloudFormation or Terraform), ensure you have access to the last known good state and the ability to revert the stack or plan to that state.

### 6. **DNS and Traffic Routing**
- [ ] **Test DNS rollback for Route 53 entries**  
  If you're updating DNS records (e.g., changing load balancer or IP), ensure you can quickly revert Route 53 entries to their previous values.
- [ ] **Use traffic shifting for deployments**  
  Consider using traffic shifting (e.g., AWS CodeDeploy with weighted target groups) to gradually move traffic to the new deployment. This allows for quick rollback if issues are detected.

### 7. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- [ ] **Verify CloudWatch and other monitoring tools are active**  
  Ensure that CloudWatch or third-party monitoring tools are tracking application performance. Configure alerts for any critical issues like high error rates or downtime.
- [ ] **Set up custom alerts for deployment success/failure**  
  Implement notifications (via SNS, Slack, or email) for any deployment failure so that you can quickly initiate a rollback if necessary.

### 8. **Rollback Testing in Staging**
- [ ] **Test rollback procedures in a staging environment**  
  Before deploying to production, perform a full test of your rollback procedures in staging, including database reversion, EC2 snapshot restoration, and redeploying the previous version of the application.
  
### 9. **Communication Plan**
- [ ] **Prepare a communication plan for stakeholders**  
  Ensure you have a communication plan ready in case the backout plan is triggered, including informing the relevant stakeholders (team leads, managers, clients) about the rollback and the next steps.
  
### 10. **Graceful Failure and User Impact**
- [ ] **Implement user-facing error pages or maintenance mode**  
  If the rollback process involves downtime, ensure that user-facing error pages or maintenance mode is in place to provide feedback to users.
  
### 11. **Rollback Execution**
- [ ] **Switch to previous application version in AWS Elastic Beanstalk (if used)**  
  If using Elastic Beanstalk, quickly revert to the previous version through the environmentâ€™s deployment history.
- [ ] **Restore EC2 instances from snapshots**  
  If the new EC2 instances fail, restore the previous instances using EBS snapshots.
- [ ] **Revert database to a previous state using RDS snapshot**  
  Restore the RDS instance to a previous snapshot in case of critical failures in the database layer.

### 12. **Post-Rollback Validation**
- [ ] **Verify the previous version is functioning correctly**  
  Once the rollback is complete, test the previous version to ensure that all functionality is restored and working as expected.
- [ ] **Monitor performance and logs post-rollback**  
  Continue monitoring CloudWatch logs and performance metrics for any residual issues after the rollback.

### 13. **Post-Incident Review**
- [ ] **Conduct a post-mortem review**  
  After completing the rollback, conduct a thorough post-mortem analysis to identify the root cause of the failure and update deployment and rollback procedures accordingly.
