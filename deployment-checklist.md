# AWS Secure Configuration Checklist for Express.js Web Application Deployment

### 1. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
- [ ] **Use least privilege access for IAM roles and users.**  
  Ensure that users, roles, and services only have the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks. Regularly audit and refine permissions using AWS IAM policies.
- [ ] **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users.**  
  MFA adds an extra layer of protection to your AWS accounts, ensuring users need more than just a password to access resources.
- [ ] **Create and use IAM roles for EC2 instances.**  
  Assign appropriate roles to your EC2 instances rather than using hardcoded credentials. This prevents credentials from being exposed within your application.

### 2. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and Networking**
- [ ] **Deploy the application in a private subnet with a NAT Gateway for outbound access.**  
  Ensure your application servers are not directly exposed to the internet. Only allow incoming traffic through a load balancer.
- [ ] **Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.**  
  Configure security groups with strict rules for ports and protocols. Only allow necessary traffic such as HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443) to the load balancer and database traffic to private subnets.
- [ ] **Set up Network ACLs for additional traffic control.**  
  Use Network ACLs to provide an additional layer of security for controlling the traffic to and from subnets.

### 3. **Load Balancing and Auto Scaling**
- [ ] **Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic.**  
  Ensure that traffic to the application is routed through an ALB, which allows for better distribution, session stickiness, and SSL termination.
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS and force SSL/TLS connections.**  
  Use an Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate to handle SSL encryption and ensure secure communication between clients and your application.
- [ ] **Enable auto-scaling for your EC2 instances.**  
  Automatically scale your instances based on demand to improve availability and avoid over-provisioning.

### 4. **AWS EC2 Instances**
- [ ] **Harden the EC2 instances by disabling SSH access from the internet.**  
  If SSH is needed, use bastion hosts or secure VPN access and ensure only necessary users can SSH into instances.
- [ ] **Use the latest Amazon Linux 2 or another secure and regularly updated OS image.**  
  Regularly apply security patches and updates to the operating system to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Use encrypted EBS volumes for all EC2 instances.**  
  Ensure all Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes attached to your EC2 instances are encrypted to protect data at rest.

### 5. **Database Security**
- [ ] **Use RDS (Relational Database Service) with encryption.**  
  Enable encryption at rest for your RDS databases and enforce encryption for connections to the database.
- [ ] **Place databases in private subnets.**  
  Ensure your RDS instances are only accessible from the application and not exposed directly to the internet.
- [ ] **Use parameterized queries and ORM frameworks to avoid SQL injection.**  
  Secure database queries within your Express.js app to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### 6. **S3 Bucket Security**
- [ ] **Enable server-side encryption for all S3 buckets.**  
  Encrypt your S3 bucket data using SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS for server-side encryption.
- [ ] **Enforce bucket policies to restrict public access.**  
  Configure bucket policies to restrict access based on conditions, ensuring the minimum necessary privileges are granted to users or services.
- [ ] **Enable logging for S3 buckets.**  
  Set up logging to track access and actions performed on your S3 buckets, enabling better monitoring and auditing.

### 7. **CloudTrail and Logging**
- [ ] **Enable AWS CloudTrail for tracking API calls.**  
  Ensure that CloudTrail is enabled for logging all AWS API calls, which helps in auditing and investigating incidents.
- [ ] **Set up CloudWatch Logs for monitoring your application.**  
  Integrate CloudWatch Logs with your Express.js application to capture application logs and monitor performance metrics.
- [ ] **Set up alerts in CloudWatch for suspicious activities.**  
  Define CloudWatch Alarms that notify you when suspicious events or thresholds are exceeded (e.g., unusual traffic spikes or resource usage).

### 8. **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
- [ ] **Set up AWS WAF to protect against web attacks.**  
  Configure AWS WAF to block common web attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and bad bot traffic.
- [ ] **Use AWS Shield for DDoS protection.**  
  Ensure AWS Shield Standard is enabled for basic DDoS protection, and consider AWS Shield Advanced for critical applications with higher security needs.

### 9. **Environment Variables and Secrets Management**
- [ ] **Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store to store secrets.**  
  Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, DB credentials) in environment variables. Use Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store with encryption.
- [ ] **Rotate secrets regularly.**  
  Set up automatic rotation for sensitive credentials stored in Secrets Manager to reduce the risk of exposure.

### 10. **Security Monitoring and Compliance**
- [ ] **Enable AWS Config to track resource configuration changes.**  
  Use AWS Config to ensure that all AWS resources comply with best practices and security policies.
- [ ] **Use GuardDuty to detect potential security threats.**  
  Enable GuardDuty to automatically detect threats like unusual access patterns, compromised instances, and more.
- [ ] **Regularly review the AWS Well-Architected Tool.**  
  Periodically review your application architecture using AWS Well-Architected Tool to ensure compliance with best practices and security standards.

### 11. **Backups and Disaster Recovery**
- [ ] **Set up automatic backups for databases and key resources.**  
  Use automated backups for RDS and EBS to ensure recoverability in case of data loss or failure.
- [ ] **Enable cross-region replication for critical data.**  
  Ensure critical resources like databases and S3 buckets are replicated across regions for disaster recovery purposes.
- [ ] **Test disaster recovery procedures regularly.**  
  Ensure that your team periodically runs drills for disaster recovery scenarios to ensure readiness in case of an outage or security incident.
